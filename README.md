=============

Always use the mobile version of Wikipedia.

Wikipedia's mobile front-end has eclipsed the traditional desktop interface in
terms of day-to-day usability, even on larger devices. It does away with the
desktop UI's towering sidebar full of useless links like "Random Page". It puts
the search bar in a prominent position. The general lack of clutter lets the
quality of the content itself shine through. For casual browsing, it's just
better.

I made this extension because I wanted a nice way of migrating permanently to
the mobile front-end. There are certainly other ways of achieving this, but I
personally wanted to use an extension for it, and there wasn't one.
